# Basic assignment
x = 5
print x

# Reassignment with expression
x = x + 3
print x

# Another variable
y = x * 2
print y

# Updating with previous variables
z = y - x
print z

# Chaining variables
a = 10
b = a + 1
c = b * 2
print a
print b
print c

# Overwriting variable
c = c - a
print c

# Mixing types
name = "Morph"
greeting = "Hello, " + name
print greeting

# Boolean with variables
flag = True
print flag
flag = not flag
print flag
